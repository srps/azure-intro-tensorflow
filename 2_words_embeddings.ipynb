    "The idea of **embedding** is to represent words using lower-dimensional dense vectors that reflect the semantic meaning of the word. We will later discuss how to build meaningful word embeddings, but for now let's just think of embeddings as a way to reduce the dimensionality of a word vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, an embedding layer takes a word as input, and produces an output vector of specified `embedding_size`. In a sense, it is very similar to a `Dense` layer, but instead of taking a one-hot encoded vector as input, it's able to take a word number.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using an embedding layer as the first layer in our network, we can switch from bag-or-words to an **embedding bag** model, where we first convert each word in our text into the corresponding embedding, and then compute some aggregate function over all those embeddings, such as `sum`, `average` or `max`.  \n",

    "Our classifier neural network consists of the following layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TextVectorization` layer, which takes a string as input, and produces a tensor of token numbers. We will specify some reasonable vocabulary size `vocab_size`, and ignore less-frequently used words. The input shape will be 1, and the output shape will be $n$, since we'll get $n$ tokens as a result, each of them containing numbers from 0 to `vocab_size`.\n",
    "* `Embedding` layer, which takes $n$ numbers, and reduces each number to a dense vector of a given length (100 in our example). Thus, the input tensor of shape $n$ will be transformed into an $n\\times 100$ tensor. \n",
    "* Aggregation layer, which takes the average of this tensor along the first axis, i.e. it will compute the average of all $n$ input tensors corresponding to different words. To implement this layer, we will use a `Lambda` layer, and pass into it the function to compute the average. The output will have shape of 100, and it will be the numeric representation of the whole input sequence.\n",

This exercise goes beyond this module, but those interested might want to check out this [official TensorFlow tutorial on training Word2Vec model](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec). Also, the **gensim** framework can be used to train the most commonly used embeddings in a few lines of code, as described [in the official documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_word2vec.html#training-your-own-model)."

    "\n",
    "The pretrained embeddings we talked about represent both meanings of the word 'play' in the same embedding. To overcome this limitation, we need to build embeddings based on the **language model**, which is trained on a large corpus of text, and *knows* how words can be put together in different contexts. Discussing contextual embeddings is out of scope for this tutorial, but we will come back to them when talking about language models in the next unit.\n"
