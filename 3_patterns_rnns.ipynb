    "# Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous module, we covered rich semantic representations of text. The architecture we've been using captures the aggregated meaning of words in a sentence, but it does not take into account the **order** of the words, because the aggregation operation that follows the embeddings removes this information from the original text. Because these models are unable to represent word ordering, they cannot solve more complex or ambiguous tasks such as text generation or question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the meaning of a text sequence, we'll use a neural network architecture called **recurrent neural network**, or RNN. When using an RNN, we pass our sentence through the network one token at a time, and the network produces some **state**, which we then pass to the network again with the next token.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image showing an example recurrent neural network generation.](notebooks/images/rnn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the input sequence of tokens $X_0,\\dots,X_n$, the RNN creates a sequence of neural network blocks, and trains this sequence end-to-end using backpropagation. Each network block takes a pair $(X_i,S_i)$ as an input, and produces $S_{i+1}$ as a result. The final state $S_n$ or output $Y_n$ goes into a linear classifier to produce the result. All network blocks share the same weights, and are trained end-to-end using one backpropagation pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The figure above shows recurrent neural network in the unrolled form (on the left), and in more compact recurrent representation (on the right). It is important to realize that all RNN Cells have the same **shareable weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because state vectors $S_0,\\dots,S_n$ are passed through the network, the RNN is able to learn sequential dependencies between words. For example, when the word *not* appears somewhere in the sequence, it can learn to negate certain elements within the state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside, each RNN cell contains two weight matrices: $W_H$ and $W_I$, and bias $b$. At each RNN step, given input $X_i$ and input state $S_i$, output state is calculated as $S_{i+1} = f(W_H\\times S_i + W_I\\times X_i+b)$, where $f$ is an activation function (often $\\tanh$).\n",
    "\n",
    "> For problems like text generation (that we will cover in the next unit) or machine translation we also want to get some output value at each RNN step. In this case, there is also another matrix $W_O$, and output is caluclated as $Y_i=f(W_O\\times S_i+b_O)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how recurrent neural networks can help us classify our news dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the sandbox environment, we need to run the following cell to make sure the required library is installed, and data is prefetched. If you are running locally, you can skip the following cell."

    "Remember that the `TextVectorization` layer will automatically pad sequences of variable length in a minibatch with pad tokens. It turns out that those tokens also take part in training, and they can complicate convergence of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches we can take to minimize the amount of padding. One of them is to reorder the dataset by sequence length and group all sequences by size. This can be done using the `tf.data.experimental.bucket_by_sequence_length` function (see [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/bucket_by_sequence_length)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to use **masking**. In Keras, some layers support additional input that shows which tokens should be taken into account when training. To incorporate masking into our model, we can either include a separate `Masking` layer ([docs](https://keras.io/api/layers/core_layers/masking/)), or we can specify the `mask_zero=True` parameter of our `Embedding` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: This training will take around 5 minutes to complete one epoch on the whole dataset. Feel free to interrupt training at any time if you run out of patience. What you can also do is limit the amount of data used for training, by adding `.take(...)` clause after `ds_train` and `ds_test` datasets."

    "\n",
    "One of the main problems of RNNs is **vanishing gradients**. RNNs can be pretty long, and may have a hard time propagating the gradients all the way back to the first layer of the network during backpropagation. When this happens, the network cannot learn relationships between distant tokens. One way to avoid this problem is to introduce **explicit state management** by using **gates**. The two most common architectures that introduce gates are **long short-term memory** (LSTM) and **gated relay unit** (GRU). We'll cover LSTMs here.\n",

    "An LSTM network is organized in a manner similar to an RNN, but there are two states that are passed from layer to layer: the actual state $c$, and the hidden vector $h$. At each unit, the hidden vector $h_{t-1}$ is combined with input $x_t$, and together they control what happens to the state $c_t$ and output $h_{t}$ through **gates**. Each gate has sigmoid activation (output in the range $[0,1]$), which can be thought of as a bitwise mask when multiplied by the state vector. LSTMs have the following gates (from left to right on the picture above):\n",
    "* **forget gate** which determines which components of the vector $c_{t-1}$ we need to forget, and which to pass through. \n",
    "* **input gate** which determines how much information from the input vector and previous hidden vector should be incorporated into the state vector.\n",
    "* **output gate** which takes the new state vector and decides which of its components will be used to produce the new hidden vector $h_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The components of the state $c$ can be thought of as flags that can be switched on and off. For example, when we encounter the name *Alice* in the sequence, we guess that it refers to a woman, and raise the flag in the state that says we have a female noun in the sentence. When we further encounter the words *and Tom*, we will raise the flag that says we have a plural noun. Thus by manipulating state we can keep track of the grammatical properties of the sentence.\n",

This feels natural to us because it follows the same direction in which we read or listen to speech. However, for scenarios which require random access of the input sequence, it makes more sense to run the recurrent computation in both directions. RNNs that allow computations in both directions are called **bidirectional** RNNs, and they can be created by wrapping the recurrent layer with a special `Bidirectonal` layer.\n",

As with convolutional networks, we can build another recurrent layer following the first one to capture higher level patterns, built from lower level patterns extracted by the first layer.
