# Introduction to Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow

## Description

This project is based on the [Introduction to natural language processing with TensorFlow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/intro-natural-language-processing-tensorflow/) module, part of the [Tensorflow Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/tensorflow-fundamentals/) path on Microsoft Learn.

It contains several Jupyter notebooks that guide you through different aspects of TensorFlow and natural language processing.

As opposed to the online Azure notebook, this uses recent versions of Python, Tensorflow, and other packages. The code is updated as well so all examples run flawlessly.
